# 2 Player Control Deck

I started on a  2 player control deck using scrap wood I had laying around.

The top surface is very rough,  ven for a prototype.  I might end up replacing it.
I drilled holes the using the Sega player 2 template from [slagcoin](slagcoin.com).

The joystick seems a little close for me. Not sure where is best for the admin buttons. and the power buttons.
