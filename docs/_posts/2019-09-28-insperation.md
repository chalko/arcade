# Check this out dad

My son Kyle sent this picture of an arcade cabinet! [Frys Arcade cabinet]({{ site.url }}/assets/frys-arcde.jpg) from Frys.  
I said don't but it, I can make you one for Christmas.  Only it
turns Kyle did not actualy want one, just thought it was cool.
 
So I am going to build one for myself.
