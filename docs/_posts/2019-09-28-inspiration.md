# Check this out Dad

My son Kyle sent this picture of an arcade cabinet ![Frys Arcade cabinet](/assets/frys-arcade.jpg) from Frys.  
I said don't but it, I can make you one for Christmas.  Only it
turns Kyle did not actualy want one, just thought it was cool.
 
So I am going to build one for myself.
