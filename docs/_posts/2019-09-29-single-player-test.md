# A single player test rig

I started by building a single player test rig to learn about [RetroPie](retropie.or.ok).

I used a RaspberryPie 3 b+, with a 
[Picade X HAT](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3402) and a 
[2 player set of buttons and joysticks](https://shop.xgaming.com/collections/arcade-parts/products/arcade-bundle-2-joysticks-20-buttons)
from [XArcade](https://shop.xgaming.com/).

My grandson liked it ![Testing TMNT]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_20190926_171145.jpg)

But there was several problems.

I bought a [On off switch](https://www.adafruit.com/product/482) but the Picade X HAT expects a momentary switch.
I also need to test out using a [Player X USB Games Controller](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/player-x-usb-games-controller-pcb) for the second player.

My test using the Picade X HAT and a bluetooth controller failed, so my next step is to build a 2 player control panel.
