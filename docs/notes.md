###Buttons
Button layout template from slagcoin 
[Sega printed at 96 dpi](https://www.slagcoin.com/joystick/layout/sega2_m.png)

The arcade stick is too close

Mouting pi and hats.
Super glue with nylon off sets is weak

With plywood driling 3/32 hole works well with nylon and brass m2.5 screw offsets

For the button assignments I am using the 
[libretro MAME 2003+ Modern Fightstick layout](https://docs.libretro.com/library/mame2003_plus/#default-retropad-layouts)
